  abstract = {Background Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a known trigger and risk factor for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and post-COVID syndrome (PCS). In previous studies, we found enhanced IgG reactivity to EBV EBNA4 and EBNA6 arginine-rich sequences in postinfectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS).Objective This study aims to investigate IgG responses to arginine-rich (poly-R) EBNA4 and EBNA6 sequences and homologous human sequences in PCS and ME/CFS.Methods The IgG responses against poly-R EBNA4 and EBNA6 and corresponding homologous human 15-mer peptides and respective full-length proteins were analyzed using a cytometric bead array (CBA) and a multiplex dot-blot assay. Sera of 45 PCS patients diagnosed according to WHO criteria, with 26 patients fulfilling the Canadian Consensus criteria for ME/CFS (pcME/CFS), 36 patients with non-COVID post-infectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS), and 34 healthy controls (HC) were investigated.Results Autoantibodies to poly-R peptide sequences of the neuronal antigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, TGF-β signaling regulator TSPLY2, angiogenic regulator TSPYL5, as well as to full-length α-adrenergic receptor (ADRA) proteins were more frequent in patients. Several autoantibodies were positively associated with key symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognition, and pain.Conclusion Collectively, we identified autoantibodies with new antigen specificities with a potential role in PCS and ME/CFS.Clinical Implication These finding should prompt further studies on the function of these autoantibodies, their exploitation for diagnostic use, and of drugs targeting autoantibodies.Capsule summary Our study reveals elevated autoantibodies to EBV-related poly-R sequences and their human homologues in PCS and ME/CFS patients associated with symptom severity, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, project Immune Mechanisms of ME/CFS (IMMME, 01EJ2204D). Furthermore, funding was received from the Weidenhammer Zoebele Foundation and Fatigatio e.V. for consumables, as well as the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium fuer Gesundheit, BMG) for the patient data and blood sample collection within the German ME/CFS registry.
