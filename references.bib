  abstract = {Background Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a known trigger and risk factor for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and post-COVID syndrome (PCS). In previous studies, we found enhanced IgG reactivity to EBV EBNA4 and EBNA6 arginine-rich sequences in postinfectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS).Objective This study aims to investigate IgG responses to arginine-rich (poly-R) EBNA4 and EBNA6 sequences and homologous human sequences in PCS and ME/CFS.Methods The IgG responses against poly-R EBNA4 and EBNA6 and corresponding homologous human 15-mer peptides and respective full-length proteins were analyzed using a cytometric bead array (CBA) and a multiplex dot-blot assay. Sera of 45 PCS patients diagnosed according to WHO criteria, with 26 patients fulfilling the Canadian Consensus criteria for ME/CFS (pcME/CFS), 36 patients with non-COVID post-infectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS), and 34 healthy controls (HC) were investigated.Results Autoantibodies to poly-R peptide sequences of the neuronal antigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, TGF-β signaling regulator TSPLY2, angiogenic regulator TSPYL5, as well as to full-length α-adrenergic receptor (ADRA) proteins were more frequent in patients. Several autoantibodies were positively associated with key symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognition, and pain.Conclusion Collectively, we identified autoantibodies with new antigen specificities with a potential role in PCS and ME/CFS.Clinical Implication These finding should prompt further studies on the function of these autoantibodies, their exploitation for diagnostic use, and of drugs targeting autoantibodies.Capsule summary Our study reveals elevated autoantibodies to EBV-related poly-R sequences and their human homologues in PCS and ME/CFS patients associated with symptom severity, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung, BMBF, project Immune Mechanisms of ME/CFS (IMMME, 01EJ2204D).

  abstract = {Post-acute infection syndromes may develop after acute viral disease1. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in the development of a post-acute infection syndrome known as long COVID. Individuals with long COVID frequently report unremitting fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and a variety of cognitive and autonomic dysfunctions2–4. However, the biological processes that are associated with the development and persistence of these symptoms are unclear. Here 275 individuals with or without long COVID were enrolled in a cross-sectional study that included multidimensional immune phenotyping and unbiased machine learning methods to identify biological features associated with long COVID. Marked differences were noted in circulating myeloid and lymphocyte populations relative to the matched controls, as well as evidence of exaggerated humoral responses directed against SARS-CoV-2 among participants with long COVID. Furthermore, higher antibody responses directed against non-SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogens were observed among individuals with long COVID, particularly Epstein–Barr virus. Levels of soluble immune mediators and hormones varied among groups, with cortisol levels being lower among participants with long COVID. Integration of immune phenotyping data into unbiased machine learning models identified the key features that are most strongly associated with long COVID status. Collectively, these findings may help to guide future studies into the pathobiology of long COVID and help with developing relevant biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and fibromyalgia (FM) are two chronic complex diseases with overlapping symptoms affecting multiple systems and organs over time. Due to the absence of validated biomarkers and similarity in symptoms, both disorders are misdiagnosed, and the comorbidity of the two is often unrecognized. Our study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of 11 circulating miRNAs previously associated with ME/CFS pathogenesis in FM patients and individuals with a comorbid diagnosis of FM associated with ME/CFS (ME/CFS\,+\,FM), and matched sedentary healthy controls. Whether these 11 circulating miRNAs expression can differentiate between the two disorders was also examined. Our results highlight differential circulating miRNAs expression signatures between ME/CFS, FM and ME/CFS\,+\,FM, which also correlate to symptom severity between ME/CFS and ME/CFS\,+\,FM groups. We provided a prediction model, by using a machine-learning approach based on 11 circulating miRNAs levels, which can be used to discriminate between patients suffering from ME/CFS, FM and ME/CFS\,+\,FM. These 11 miRNAs are proposed as potential biomarkers for discriminating ME/CFS from FM. The results of this study demonstrate that ME/CFS and FM are two distinct illnesses, and we highlight the comorbidity between the two conditions. Proper diagnosis of patients suffering from ME/CFS, FM or ME/CFS\,+\,FM is crucial to elucidate the pathophysiology of both diseases, determine preventive measures, and establish more effective treatments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a concise and statistically robust instrument to assess autonomic symptoms that provides clinically relevant scores of autonomic symptom severity based on the well-established 169-item Autonomic Symptom Profile (ASP) and its validated 84-question scoring instrument, the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the internal consistency of COMPASS using Cronbach α coefficients based on the ASP of 405 healthy control subjects recruited and seen in the Mayo Clinic Autonomic Disorders Center between March 1, 1995, and March 31, 2010. Applying a simplified scoring algorithm, we then used exploratory factor analysis with orthogonal rotation and eigenvalue calculations to extract internally consistent domains and to reduce dimensionality. This analysis was followed by expert revisions to eliminate redundant content and to retain clinically important questions and final assessment of the new instrument. RESULTS: The new simplified scoring algorithm alone resulted in higher Cronbach α values in all domains. Factor analysis revealed 7 domains with a total of 54 questions retained. Expert revisions resulted in further reduction of questions and domains with a remaining total of 31 questions in 6 domains (COMPASS 31). Measures of internal consistency were much improved compared to those for COMPASS. Following appropriate weighting, this instrument provides an autonomic symptom score from 0 to 100. CONCLUSION: COMPASS 31 is a refined, internally consistent, and markedly abbreviated quantitative measure of autonomic symptoms. It is based on the original ASP and COMPASS, applies a much simplified scoring algorithm, and is suitable for widespread use in autonomic research and practice.},
