  abstract = {Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), represents a major global health challenge, with its underlying mechanisms remaining poorly understood despite substantial research and clinical trials. This study investigates the role of the interferon (IFN) axis in the pathogenesis of PASC, drawing parallels to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The potential pathogenic role of IFNs was detected by meta-analyses of mRNA sequencing data comparing PASC patients to healthy controls. We analyzed serum samples from 39 PASC patients and found significant correlations among multiple IFN sub types, including IFN alpha-2, beta, gamma, lambda-1, and lambda-2/3. The biological activity of IFNs in the serum was positively correlated with levels of both total and type III IFNs. Notably, we detected the widespread presence of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibodies in these patients, with anti-dsDNA levels showing a strong correlation with IFN activity. On the basis of these findings, we propose a hypothetical autoimmune pathogenesis for PASC highlighting the crucial role of IFN signaling.},

  abstract = {Post-acute infection syndromes may develop after acute viral disease1. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in the development of a post-acute infection syndrome known as long COVID. Individuals with long COVID frequently report unremitting fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and a variety of cognitive and autonomic dysfunctions2–4. However, the biological processes that are associated with the development and persistence of these symptoms are unclear. Here 275 individuals with or without long COVID were enrolled in a cross-sectional study that included multidimensional immune phenotyping and unbiased machine learning methods to identify biological features associated with long COVID. Marked differences were noted in circulating myeloid and lymphocyte populations relative to the matched controls, as well as evidence of exaggerated humoral responses directed against SARS-CoV-2 among participants with long COVID. Furthermore, higher antibody responses directed against non-SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogens were observed among individuals with long COVID, particularly Epstein–Barr virus. Levels of soluble immune mediators and hormones varied among groups, with cortisol levels being lower among participants with long COVID. Integration of immune phenotyping data into unbiased machine learning models identified the key features that are most strongly associated with long COVID status. Collectively, these findings may help to guide future studies into the pathobiology of long COVID and help with developing relevant biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and fibromyalgia (FM) are two chronic complex diseases with overlapping symptoms affecting multiple systems and organs over time. Due to the absence of validated biomarkers and similarity in symptoms, both disorders are misdiagnosed, and the comorbidity of the two is often unrecognized. Our study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of 11 circulating miRNAs previously associated with ME/CFS pathogenesis in FM patients and individuals with a comorbid diagnosis of FM associated with ME/CFS (ME/CFS\,+\,FM), and matched sedentary healthy controls. Whether these 11 circulating miRNAs expression can differentiate between the two disorders was also examined. Our results highlight differential circulating miRNAs expression signatures between ME/CFS, FM and ME/CFS\,+\,FM, which also correlate to symptom severity between ME/CFS and ME/CFS\,+\,FM groups. We provided a prediction model, by using a machine-learning approach based on 11 circulating miRNAs levels, which can be used to discriminate between patients suffering from ME/CFS, FM and ME/CFS\,+\,FM. These 11 miRNAs are proposed as potential biomarkers for discriminating ME/CFS from FM. The results of this study demonstrate that ME/CFS and FM are two distinct illnesses, and we highlight the comorbidity between the two conditions. Proper diagnosis of patients suffering from ME/CFS, FM or ME/CFS\,+\,FM is crucial to elucidate the pathophysiology of both diseases, determine preventive measures, and establish more effective treatments.},
