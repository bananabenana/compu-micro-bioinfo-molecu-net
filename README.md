## About me
I am a research scientist in microbiology and infectious diseases. I am an expert in molecular biology, microbiology and comptuational biology/bioinformatics. I love doing science as a day job, in particular analysing and visualising data. I've spent a lot of time looking at bacterial pathogens and how they transmit, along with their evolution, metabolism and resistance. My main focus is developing strategies to prevent and limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance through vaccine design, novel antimicrobial discovery, gene technologies and genomic surveillance.

I currently work as a postdoc at the [Department of Infectious Diseases](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/translational/infectious-diseases), Monash University *(2020-Current)*.

# Inspo and motivation
Starting this blog was motivated by a yearning for >300 character-self-expression in a semi-professional context, while providing a potentially useful resource for other scientists or dabbling computational biologists. I was inspired by the informative and enjoyable blogs of several peers. The blog title is inspired by the Marge Simpson-suggested [Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net), because *what am I gonna call my [blog]? All the good names are taken.*
