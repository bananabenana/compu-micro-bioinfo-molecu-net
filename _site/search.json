  "content": "I want to gush about Scienceworks. In case you aren’t aware, Scienceworks is a museum in Victoria, Australia. It is thoughtfully designed and after having spent a day here with a nuclear family with two children &lt;10, I can safely say it appeals to the entire age range. So I wanted to go through all the genius design choices of Scienceworks that I picked up. If you want the tl;dr: Great interactive exhibits, creative use of space, many places to sit and chill and an adventure-guided layout. It creates a real harmonious day out for family or couples or lone travellers. 10/10 would recommend. Me standing below the epic moon, outside the Planetarium. Chuffed as. Economical use of space One of the most impressive things about Scienceworks is that it really isn’t a large museum. It’s got maybe 2 levels and a really small footprint, yet they make such economic use of their space, yet it doesn’t feel small. The high density of exhibits combined with the open and adventure-guided, free-flowing design allows you to get lost in the moment but still unconciously progress through the museum. They really let you explore your own way - you can take mulitple paths, seeing different exhibits along every path. Even going from one section to another is filled with interesting things to look at and learn from. Huge number of interactive exhibits From the perspective of children and teenagers, there is so many interactive exhibits. I would guess at least 80% of exhibits allow you to tactilely move things, or squeeze them, or press them, or experience them in at least one way - sometimes multiple! I even saw many parents playing, both with their children and for their own curiousity. Each exhibited piece is so thoughtfully designed, while focusing on genuinely educating kids, and even their parents too. CSIRAC computer operated between 1949-1964. Not only are there lots of thoughtfully-designed exhibits, but a huge diversity of topics are covered: health, the human body, energy, medicine, technology, architecture, computational history and so on. Genuinely impressive array of things to learn. I feel like I am pretty into science and technology, generally. I keep up to date-ish on these areas, and even I learned probabably about ~5 things I didn’t know before, which is always ideal. Truly, I think this is becauise Scienceworks makes learning a dream, and the content is so curated that it’s just so interesting. Their ability to educate even adults is impressive. I tried to interact with every exhibit I could find in my ~4 hours there. I had a lot of fun. Abundant and comfy seating What’s so genius about the design of Scienceworks is the well-placed seating all across the museum which I could see all parents appreciating. For example, there are these amazing indoor playgrounds for kids, and they are surrounded by soft, plentiful seating for parents. There is a sonic experience floor upstairs where you can just lie down on any of 30 couches and hear chill music beats and feel bass pumping through your body as you watch cool lighwave animations. I spent a huge chunk of time just chilling here. Good design leads to harmony I’ve been to Scienceworks probably 2 or 3 times before this - once in primary school, where I didn’t have free-roam exploration and didn’t get to see everything. Then, I went another time with my parents. I remembered a few exhibits (skeleton bicycle, racing Cathy Freeman), but wasn’t sure if it was actually good or was I just a kid who didn’t know any better. Across my 4 hours at Scienceworks I heard no children crying. I saw a lot of children being amazed and affixed, mouths open in astonishment as they were learning and experiencing knowledge via interaction. What really made me appreciate this even more, was seeing their parent/s and the smiles on their faces, watching their children interact with and change the world around them, being fascinated and learning. I could see how it brought joy to entire families - actual, true joy. And that’s what I felt today - genuine joy. Rarely when I go out do I feel joy. I mean I have a good time, but joy - that’s something much more profound. I really like staying at home, cos I have a good time at home. I have so much stuff I want to do at home, so I’m never bored. But it’s not often joy. What is so great about Scienceworks is that instead of having discrete playgrounds then exhibits, the exhibits ARE the playground. They’re not seperate. ground up interactive playground Insanely good value Honestly, the long term planning of Scienceworks is inspiring. How are they funded? It ONLY costs $15 to enter as an adult!? What. Insanity. The value for money here is nuts. This is truly a hidden gem within the greater Melbourne area - so seemingly well hidden that I got a carpark within a 30 second walk of the entrance on Saturday at 11 AM, full of families running around. The staff are also super chill, will legitimately help you and are approachable and friendly. They really treat you with respect and patience. I think we’ve all been to museums or public learning spaces and are just not really designed for children. I genuinely had a wonderful day accompanying a 2-child couple. Imagine that? All this made me want to donate (which I did) and make sure this modern artform of mixing education with interaction can be studied and learned from. Scienceworks is the gold standard in spatial design, who really practises what they preach with regards to the exhibits and statements they make. Medicine across time Critisisms I only really have two critiques: It is a pain to get to. People don’t live around there, and you have to drive and it’s not exactly close to anything, I feel like some of the exhibits, while amazing, are outdated. There isnt a lot of biology/medicine here, which is honestly the biggest science today. the exhibits are great, but I think there needs to be a shift to more modern science. I did see they talked about gravitational waves upstairs in the galaxy section which was excellent.This section was actually fairly modern and I have no negative things to say about this. I loved the vibrating soundscape couch experience, I would have stayed and chilled there for hours if my party didn’t say they were going. Final thoughts So visit this wonderful place with anyone, or no one, and any time before 4 PM, and do whatever you want there. Go for a walk, have a chat, bring your kids, learn some things.",

  "content": "As someone who started their scientific career in the wet lab dealing with single strains and cloning, I was never taught to think at scale. Only when I started dealing with large datasets in the computational space, did this become an essential skill and design philosophy that I needed to develop. This sort of thinking has not only improved my capabilities and speed at which I can figure things out, but it has also improved my laboratory planning and execution. “You take the blue pipette: the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pipette: you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.” Scale demands automation/parallel processes Not sure if anyone else feels this way, but when I have to perform tasks which cannot be automated or parallelised, it makes me annoyed and then I start looking for places to shave time and effort. If I have to open Excel or navigate a GUI, each additional click feels like a personal attack on my limited time, often requiring repetitive busywork. For example, I see single-channel pipetting as a for loop: An elegant instrument for a more civilized age for i in {1..8}; do mv \"tube_${i}/cells\" \"new_tube_${i}/media+cells\" done For loops are great because they are automated, but suffer from sequentiality, making them slow. Single-channel pipettes offer the worst of both worlds in that they are both manual and sequential. Nowadays in the lab (when I get to go in), I try to design experiments at scale with multi-channel pipettes, keeping gnu parallel in mind: M-m-m-multi kill ls -1 tube_*/cells | parallel -j 8 ' dir=$(dirname {}) base=$(basename {}) mv {} new_${dir}/$base ' Yes, I am aware one shouldn’t multi-thread I/O-bound tasks like mv, but the pipette-aphor works. Importantly, this means I can test more bacterial isolates, more substrates/reagents and gain more statistical power with replicates. It’s a little more complex to set up and perform, but the payoff is worth it. But yes, sometimes you can get parallelisation paralysation. But more generally, this serves as a self-reminder that I should spend more time planning and less time executing. Bioinformatics is part of the modern biologists’ toolkit Go find a few random top biology papers published in the past 5 years. Almost all will have at least some computational/bioinformatic components, be it DNA/RNA sequencing, phylogenetics/evolutionary analysis, structural analysis, molecular dynamics, simulations, modelling etc. There are many reasons for this, but simply put: computational approaches are high-yield science. They produce large amounts of data which can be leveraged in multiple different ways, and guarantee at mininum, a minimal publishable unit (as long as experiments were robustly designed). Critically, this workflow generates experimental leads which can then be capitalised on and validated/rejected. Yet, as far as I am aware, bioinformatics and data science are not core units in many biology/biomedical science degrees. We have faced difficulty recruiting students within our area (computational microbiology) despite the underlying academic sexiness of infectious diseases and the inherent global problem of antimicrobial resistance. Napkin math, but I would put antimicrobial resistance somewhere in the top 10 current/future global issues in terms of severity, likelihood and scale of impact, just below: Climate change and it’s myriad of flow-on effects Nuclear annihilation The ongoing holocene mass extinction causing ecosystem collapse Wealth inequality and food/water insecurity (currently exacerbated by 1 and 3) Global conflicts/wars/genocides (exacerbating 2.) Students I’ve talked to understand that antimicrobial resistance is an important issue, but are not being equipped appropriately in the context of modern science. Their experience with undergraduate bioinformatics envokes eye-rolling groans instead of excitement at the unlimited potential the discipline is capable of (and currently operating at 🔥🔥). When all you’re taught how to do is a web BLAST and manually inspect plasmid restriction sites via eyeball-scanning A’s G’s, T’s and C’s, I don’t blame them. This should change, and hopefully it already has in some places. This hinders a lot of current wet lab research in my opinion, which could benefit from even small amounts of comptuational/bioinformatic techniques. Because that’s the thing - these are just tools and techniques like everything else in biology. If one needs to clone a gene, they use molecular biology. If one need to look for a gene target within a population, they’d use alignments (or HMMs). If one wants to ensure the allelic variant they intend on cloning isn’t unique to their weird, historically-used lab strain, they’d first analyse this with population genomics. This would not only give them a cool initial result, but could drive experimental design - maybe they might then want to clone a few of the most prevalent allelic protein variants in parallel! My personal, integrated bioinformatics approach Nowadays, I won’t step foot in the lab until I’ve done the prerequisite bioinformatics. For me, this makes the lab a place of hypothesis validation/rejection rather than meandering discovery (which I have nothing against). This bioinformatically-driven decision-making covers everything from strain selection, substrate/antibiotic/antiseptic choice, power calculations, in silico PCR design against populations - all in an effort to maximise experimental discovery while minimising time and effort spent (and plastic waste generated). Though I am a naturally lazy person, so maybe that’s the real reason and everything else is post hoc rationalisation. In terms of postgraduate students, we offer them hybrid wet and dry-lab projects (1–5) (which I have disgustingly heard referred to as moist-lab) to address this training gap. This ensures students get cross-disciplinary experience and understand these disciplines are not siloed but regularly bridged to maximise scientific gain. Summary I have found that harnessing my inner laziness has led to increased productivity and better science, where doing more initial work leads to less overall work, thus giving me more time to spend on reducing the time I spend on even more things. In other words: Spend more time working out how to spend less time working so you have more *less* time for other work. Supplemental methods Vector images drawn in Inkscape v1.3.2 (6).

  "content": "My usual relationship with extra-curricular projects has a half-life that’s measured in single afternoons rather than the desired weeks/months. As such, it was a bit of work figuring out the underlying tooling, workflow and architecture to make the blogging process sticky, yet frictionless as possible. In other words, I wanted to maximise sticktionlessness. For me, that starts with automation. Half-life decay in hours of various personal projects of mine. R code here Setting up the workflow Background: I set this up with git, hosted on GitHub. I run a combination of WSL2 on Windows 10, and Pop_OS! 22.04 for command line interface. Steps: 1. Decide on a post title and alter the todays_title variable, then run the following chunk in terminal: # Decide on title todays_title=Blog_back_end_automation-ish # Go to blog directory cd compu-micro-bioinfo-molecu-net # Grab today's date todays_date=$(date +\"%F\") # Generate the title string title_string=${todays_date}_${todays_title} ## Generate post framework # Create directory for new post mkdir -p Posts/${title_string} # Replace underscores with spaces for the post header post_title=$(echo \"${todays_title}\" | sed 's/_/ /g') # Create markdown file as a draft with headings and date echo -e \"# ${post_title}\\n\\n##### ${todays_date}\\n\\nintro_paragraph_here\\n\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\n\\n## Heading1\\n\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\n\\n## Supplemental methods\\n\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\n\\n## References\\n\\n\" \\ &gt; Posts/${title_string}/${title_string}_draft.md 2. Then I have to actually write the post. I write in VSCode v1.104.1 (1), with the incredibly helpful Markdown Preview Enhanced v0.8.19 (2) to see the mature markdown in real-time Citations are managed with Zotero v7.0.15 (3) with the Better Bibtex for Zotero v7.0.50 plugin (4). The VSCode plugin VSCode Zotero v1.1.1 (5) is used to handle in-text citations and generation of the references.bib. VSCode with Markdown Preview Enhanced viewing the .md file from Step 1. 3. After painstakingly crafting a blog of the highest calibre - just perfect, perfect in every way - so perfect that it could reverse itself out from beyond a cosmic event horizon, I run pandoc v3.8 (6) using a modified Vancouver.csl file to neatly generate the bibliography in markdown format: # Installed pandoc mamba create -y -n blog mamba install -y -n blog conda-forge::pandoc # Add bibliography with pandoc and generate the final post mamba activate blog pandoc \\ --from=markdown \\ --to=gfm \\ --citeproc \\ --bibliography=references.bib \\ --csl=Resources/Vancouver_modified.csl \\ --wrap=none \\ -o Posts/${title_string}/${title_string}.md \\ Posts/${title_string}/${title_string}_draft.md 4. If everything looks good, the draft is moved out of the repo and it’s perfect imperfections are hurried away from potential readers eyes. The repo is then prepped for git push and the blog post goes live: # Move the draft out of the repo mv Posts/${title_string}/${title_string}_draft.md ../Drafts # Create simlink called README.md so GitHub shows it as a main file, so I can keep the original file name - best of both worlds ln -s ${title_string}.md Posts/${title_string}/README.md # Move references file generated by VSCode Zotero in the root directory into the posts' Resource directory mv references.bib Posts/${title_string}/Resources # Update archive table in Post/README.md sed -i \"6 i |[${post_title}](${title_string}) | ${todays_date} |\" Posts/README.md # Add everything to repo git add . # Commit changes git commit -m \"Post: ${title_string}\" # Push to main git push origin main 5. The post is now live: Live post viewed on GitHub. As a result of this development, I made a stupidly high number of test commits to this repo to experiment with the visual style that I was happy with and that GitHub would correctly display in browser. While I don’t love coding, I am obsessed what it allows me to do: less overall work. So, is this process overengineered? Probably. Was it worth the challenge to set this up and have systems in place? Yes. Always yes. Anything to maximise sticktionlessness.
